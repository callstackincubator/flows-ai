A lightweight, type-safe AI workflow orchestrator inspired by Anthropic's agent patterns. Built on top of Vercel AI SDK.

## Installation

```bash
npm install flows-ai
```
## Building your first flow

The core architecture is built around the concept of a **Flow** - a simple, composable structure that can be infinitely nested.

Each flow has:
- `agent` - what to execute
- `input` - what to process
- `name` - optional name of the flow

The `input` can be a string with instructions (if the agent is a simple LLM call). If you're using control flow agents provided by our library, you will notice input can also be another flow or an array of flows.

### Agents

Agent is a simple function that gets called during flow execution:

```ts
const translationAgent = async ({ input, context }) => {
  // call an LLM, perform function call, etc.
}
```

You can do anything in your agent. You can call an LLM or execute code.

For example, to define an agent using Vercel AI SDK, you could do something like this:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

const translationAgent = async ({ input, context }) => {
  const response = await generateText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    system: 'You are a translation agent...',
    prompt: input,
  })
  return response.text
}
```

Since most of the time you will be using LLMs, we provide an `agent` helper function that takes same props as Vercel AI SDK's `generateText`. 

```ts
const translationAgent = agent({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  system: 'You are a translation agent...',
})
```

### Flow

Next, you can define your flow. You can use any of the built-in flows or define your own. In the following example, we will run two agents in sequence.

```ts
const translateFlow = sequence([
  {
    agent: 'translationAgent',
    input: 'Translate this text to English',
  },
  {
    agent: 'summaryAgent',
    input: 'Now summarize the translated text',
  }
])
```

When running in a sequence, the output of the first agent becomes the input for the next.

### Execution

To execute your flow, you can use the `execute` function. It takes your flow and a context object with agents.

```ts
execute(translateFlow, {
  agents: {
    translationAgent,
    summaryAgent
  },
	input: 'Text to translate'
})
```

In this example, we will first translate the text to English and then summarize it.
